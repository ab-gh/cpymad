Try to be consistent with the PEP8_ guidelines. Add tests for all
non-trivial functionality. `Dependency injection`_ is a great pattern to
keep modules testable.

Commits should be reversible, independent units if possible. Use descriptive
titles and also add an explaining commit message unless the modification is
trivial. See also: `A Note About Git Commit Messages`_.
